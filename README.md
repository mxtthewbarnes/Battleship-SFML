# BATTLESHIP - C++/SFML

Myself and three other students collaborated on this project.  
I worked on the front-end, learning the SFML library in and out to create a functional GUI.  
I also built the back-end implementation of the grid and ships.

## Features
- **Multiplayer on the Same Device**: Two players can take turns playing on the same computer.
- **Play Against the Computer**: A single-player mode where you can challenge an AI opponent.
- **Multiplayer via Network**: Connect and play with another player over a network.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built using SFML to provide an interactive and visually appealing game board.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays hits, misses, and the sinking of ships dynamically during gameplay.
- **Customizable Ship Placement**: Players can manually place their ships using the "click and point" system we developed
